              Last Modified: April 28, 2023 The following are the terms and
              conditions (the “Terms of Use”) of a legal agreement between you
              and Blossm Media, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates
              (“Blossm”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By accessing, browsing,
              downloading, installing, or using the Blossm website located at
              http://www.blossm.com(the "Website") or the Blossm browser
              extension (the "Software") you acknowledge that you have read,
              understood, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and to
              comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the United
              States and wherever you use the Website or Software (the
              "Agreement"). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of
              another person or legal entity, you represent that you have the
              authority to bind such person or legal entity and its affiliates
              to these Terms of Use. If you do not have such authority, or do
              not agree to these Terms of Use, do not use this Website,
              Software, or Services.
            </p>
            <p>1. Description of the services</p> The Website provides a
            platform that connects and enables the buying and selling of various
            promotions on the social media accounts of participating social
            media influencers (the “Influencers”), where advertisers (the
            “Advertisers”) can quickly buy promotional spots from the
            Influencers (e.g., the posting of Advertiser information or content
            on the Influencers’ social media accounts to help build the
            Advertiser’s social media following) (the “Promo” or “Promos”) for a
            predetermined fee. Influencers may publish their availability to
            offer Promos, including proposed pricing on the Website, as well as
            certain Metrics (as defined below), and Advertisers may access the
            selection of participating Influencers, including their services,
            prices, and Metrics, and request to purchase such Promos on the
            Website (collectively, the “Services”). Please note, an Influencer
            may refuse a Promo request if it conflicts with the Influencer’s
            content policy, in the Influencer’s sole discretion. For more
            information on how our Services work, please visit
            https://blossm.zendesk.com/hc/en-us. In order to provide Advertisers
            with additional information to select a Promo, Influencers may, at
            their sole option, install the Software to provide certain
            subscription-based social media account statistics (the “Metrics”),
            including from the Influencer’s OnlyFans account, as described in
            greater detail in our Privacy Policy. Influencers may disable the
            collection of their Metrics at any time by deleting the Software
            from their browser.
            <p>2.</p>

            <p>

            <p>
              (j) transmit any files or materials protected by intellectual
              property laws, unless you own or control the rights thereto or
              have received the necessary consent to do same;
            </p>
            <p>
              (k) utilize “software robots,” “scripts,” “spiders,” “web
              crawlers,” or utilize computer programs that recursively query the
              Website over the Internet without prior written permission from
              Blossm.

              the source code of the Software;

            <p>
              (m) copy, duplicate, reproduce, modify, or create derivate works
              based upon the Website, Software, or Services, or any portion
              thereof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, and without limiting in any way the foregoing, you
              acknowledge and agree that, as an Influencer you will not offer
              any Promo, and as an Advertiser you will not purchase or request
              any Promo, which includes or refers to any of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              (a) Obscenity (including, without limitation, any actual or
              simulated scatological, rape, incest, child pornography,
              bestiality, and other actions or materials which may be deemed
              obscene or illegal in your community)
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Actual or simulated illegal and unsafe actions (including,
              without limitation, violence, blood, torture, pain, erotic
              asphyxiation, fisting, rape themes, or any actions associated with
              causing physical or emotional harm)
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) Illegal drugs (or drugs that may be perceived as illegal in

              This list is not exclusive, and we may, at any time, prohibit any
              type of Promo that we determine, in our sole and absolute
              discretion, to be inappropriate. We reserve the right to terminate
              or suspend your access to all or part of the Website, Software,
              and the Services at any time, with or without notice, for engaging
              in any inappropriate activity. You acknowledge that you are solely
              responsible for any breach of your obligations under this

            </p>
            <p>3. Intellectual Property</p>
            <p>

            <p>4. Your Account</p>
            <p>
              In order to use the Services and communicate with Influencers
              and/or Advertisers, you are required to register for an account
              and provide us with certain information, including personal

              your registration information will be legal, accurate, current,
              and complete, and your account will only be used by you or others
              who you have provided the necessary consent to do same. You are
              responsible for the confidentiality of your account information,
              including your username and password. Any use of the Services made
              through your account is your sole responsibility. If you become

              immediately. You may cancel your account any time by deleting your
              account on the Website. We, in our sole discretion, may cancel

            <p>5. Materials/Services</p>
            <p>
              The Website, Software, and Services contain information, including
              descriptions of promotions and pricing, text, photographs, videos,
              and other materials (collectively, the "Materials") that are
              provided for your convenience and enjoyment. You agree and
              understand that the Materials might contain errors, omissions,
              inaccuracies, and outdated information. We make no representations
              or warranties as to the completeness, accuracy, adequacy, or
              reliability of any Materials and will not be liable for any lack
              of the foregoing. If an Advertiser is provided with an incorrectly
              described Service, it may be possible for a credit refund. For
              more information on refunds, please see the Refunds section of
              this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>6. Purchases and Payments</p>
            <p>
              All payments for Services purchased by Advertisers through the
              Website are made through a third-party payment processor. As such,
              the third-party payment processor’s terms and conditions, privacy
              policy, etc., will apply, and it is the Advertiser’s
              responsibility to read any such terms or policies. We will not
              process any order until the third-party payment processor notifies
              us that the full payment has been received. All payment issues
              with such third-party payment processors, such as but not limited
              to, denials, or holds on an account is the Advertiser’s sole
              responsibility. We, in our sole discretion, may cancel or put a
              hold on any purchase for any reason including, but not limited to,
              out-of-date services, mispriced services, or suspected fraudulent
              purchases.
            </p>
            <p>7. Refunds</p>
            <p>
              We, in our sole discretion, upon request, may grant Advertisers a
              credit refund (i.e., an amount credited to the Advertiser’s
              account that may only be used on the Website), solely in
              connection with the receipt of incorrect or incorrectly described
              Services. Such requests must be emailed to us at
              refunds@blossm.com within 30 days of the purchase date, from the
              email used to purchase such Services, and must include all
              relevant information about the purchase. If the information
              provided is unverifiable or deficient, we may be unable to
              complete any such requests.
            </p>
            <p>8. Influencer Code of Conduct</p>

            <p>
              (a) you will ensure to make all best efforts to provide any

              (b) you will ensure to make all best efforts to timely render the

              Service(s), beyond an initial anticipated time, are to be
              considered unreasonable delays, and we reserve the right to cancel
              the Spot and/or reverse funds from your account balance in
              connection with any unreasonable delays.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) all direct and/or consequential damages, financial or
              otherwise, which are attributable to your conduct in connection
              with providing the Service(s), and that all delays, acts, or
              omissions, performance or non-performance, intentional or
              non-intentional, in connection with your obligations under this
              Agreement, your use of the Website, Software, and or/the Services,
              are your sole responsibility and not ours.
            </p>
            <p>
              (d) during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two
              years thereafter, you shall not, directly or indirectly, either

              contact any Advertiser outside of the Services; (ii) induce,
              request, solicit, encourage, or assist any Advertiser seeking to
              divert such Advertiser, or any prospective customer of Blossm that

            </p>
            <p>
              (e) you may refuse to accept publishing a Spot if it conflicts

              request and then change your mind, you must notify us to cancel
              within 8 hours of accepting same; you further agree that we may
              assess you an administrative charge for any late cancellations of
              an accepted Service(s).
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) you acknowledge that you are responsible for complying with

            <p>
              (h) you will not modify the agreed upon Service(s) or edit any
              Spot information provided by an Advertiser and will publish same
              as received and agreed; you further agree that we reserve the
              right to reverse funds from your account balance if the Advertiser
              disputes the provision of the Service(s), in our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              (i) you will not discuss any Spot information, accepted or
              refused, outside of the Services, unless legally required.
            </p>
            <p>
              (j) you will not falsify any metrics associated with your social

            </p>
            <p>
              (l) you will take screenshots of each Spot that you publish to
              your social media accounts and upload such screenshot(s) to your
              Blossm account.
            </p>
            <p>
              (m) we may terminate your account if you violate these Terms of
              Use, in our sole discretion, and you will forfeit any account
              balance upon such termination.
            </p>
            <p>9. Term and Termination</p>
            <p>
              The term of this Agreement will begin upon your acceptance and

              terminate this Agreement at any time with or without written

              you in your use of the Services, or any other provision of this
              Agreement, we reserve the right to investigate such violations,
              and may, at our sole discretion, terminate or suspend your use of
              the Services without prior notice to you. You may terminate this
              Agreement by deleting your account. All provisions of this
              Agreement that by their nature should survive termination of this
              Agreement shall survive (including, without limitation, all
              limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations,
              disclaimers of warranties, choice of law and forum, and
              intellectual property protections).
            </p>
            <p>10. Changes to Services and Agreement</p>
            <p>
              We expressly reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue
              the Services or any parts thereof at our sole discretion at any
              time. We expressly reserve the right to make changes to this
              Agreement at any time. Your continued use of the Website or

            </p>
            <p>15. Binding Arbitration and Choice of Law</p>
            <p>
              You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of
              or related to this Agreement, or our Privacy Policy, Website,
              Software, or Services shall be settled by final and binding
              arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American
              Arbitration Association (“AAA”), rather than in a court of law.
              You agree that you are knowingly and voluntarily giving up your
              right to a trial and have your dispute heard by a judge or jury in
              a court of law. Any such dispute, claim, or controversy shall be
              arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be joined or
              consolidated with a claim of any other party or class. You agree
              that the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by this
              Agreement and any other agreement that you have with us. You agree
              that the arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be
              entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
              arbitration will be administered by the AAA, pursuant to the rules
              of the AAA. For more information on the rules, procedures, and
              fees of the AAA, please visit their website at www.adr.org. The
              foregoing shall not preclude Blossm from seeking any injunctive or
              other equitable relief in State or Federal court for protection of
              intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Agreement, including binding arbitration, will be governed by
              the law of the State of Florida, without regard to the conflict of
              laws principles thereof. If any dispute, controversy, or claims
              cannot be resolved in arbitration between the parties, then it
              shall be submitted for resolution to a court of competent
              jurisdiction in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and the Federal Courts
              in and for the Southern District of Florida, and the parties
              hereby submit that exclusive venue shall lie with such courts, and
              the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and
              venue of such courts. We recognize that the courts of some
              countries do not apply the laws of Florida, USA to certain
              disputes. If you reside in one of these countries where Florida
              law is excluded from being applied, your country’s law will then
              apply to such disputes related to this Agreement. Similarly, if
              the courts in your country do not permit you to consent to the
              jurisdiction and venue of Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, then
              your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes
              related to this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of where you reside, to the fullest extent permitted by
              law, you expressly agree that class action lawsuits, class-wide
              arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other
              proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not
              allowed, nor is combining individual proceedings without the
              consent of all parties.
            </p>
            <p>16. Entire Agreement</p>

            <p>17. Severability</p>
            <p>
              If any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or

              and shall be inoperative, and, provided that the fundamental terms

              remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>18. Force Majeure</p>
            <p>
              Any failure or delay in performance by either party shall be
              excused if and to the extent caused by an Act of God (fire, flood,
