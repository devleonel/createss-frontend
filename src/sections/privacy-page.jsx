            </p>
            <p>What is Biometric Data</p>
            <p>
              Biometric data is any biological characteristics of a person, or
              information based upon such a characteristic, including
              characteristics such as those defined as "biometric identifiers"
              and "biometric information" under the Illinois Biometric
              Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. "Biometric
              identifier" means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint,
              or scan of hand or face geometry. "Biometric information" means
              any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted,
              stored, or shared, based on an individual's biometric identifier
              used to identify an individual.
            </p>
            <p>Biometric Data We May Collect and Process</p>
            <p>
              When you submit Identity Verification Documents either directly to
              us or through a secure third party, a three-dimensional scan of
              your face geometry will be taken. You will be prompted to take a
              short burst/series of images of your face using the camera on your
              mobile device or other internet connected webcam. We, directly or
              through a secure third party, may also collect a similar face
              geometry during your live video broadcasts on the Platform for
              comparison to the biometric data collected during submission of
              your Identity Verification Documents.
            </p>
            <p>Why is Biometric Data Collected?</p>
            <p>
              Your biometric data is collected and used for identity
              verification purposes in furtherance of our identity verification
              procedures and practices, which exist to prevent fraudulent and
              other unauthorized use of the Blossm platform. This information is
              used to further ensure that the individual providing the Identity
              Verification Documents is the person depicted in such documents
              and the person accessing the account(s) with which such documents
              are associated.
            </p>
            <p>How is Your Biometric Data Stored?</p>
            <p>
              The photo of your face from your Identity Verification Documents
              (the "Selfie") will be cropped and stored separately from your
              original Identity Verification Documents and made available
              through a secure, close-ended system to our team of reviewers to
              confirm that you are the person appearing through your account.
              Your Identity Verification Documents with your date of birth and
              real name will be stored separately in a secure system. Your
              Identity Verification Documents will only be reviewed by members
              of our team engaged in identity verification and routine audits of
              previously submitted identity verification. Any and all biometric
              data generated from your Identity Verification Documents (the
              "Biometric Data") is also stored securely and separately apart
              from your Selfie. The Biometric Data will only be used to verify
              your identification.
            </p>
            <p>How Long is Your Biometric Data Stored?</p>
            <p>
              Your Biometric Data will be retained for the same period as your
              Identity Verification Documents, where certain information may be
              retained in compliance with legal and other obligations. To the
              extent that such information is retained, it is retained solely to
              comply with relevant obligations and is not accessible by users.
            </p>
            <p>No Obligation to Accept Identity Verification Documents</p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the
              right to specify which government issued identification may be
              accepted based upon your location and our sole determination of
              the reliability of such documentation. As an example of
              documentation we do not accept, by way of example only and not
              limitation, we do not accept handwritten and/or paper documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, as more fully detailed throughout the Platform,
              particularly during the identity verification process, the
              acceptable government-issued identification must contain a
              photograph of you that is both recent and recognizable. Again, by
              way of example only, identification containing photos of you as a
              young minor or photos from several years ago, regardless of your
              current age or age at the time the image was taken, may be
              rejected under this requirement. Additionally, by way of further
              example only, identification containing recent images which do not
              reflect alterations(such as surgeries, piercings, tattoos, or
              other modifications, whether temporary or permanent) in your face
              may also be rejected.
